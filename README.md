# Diversity and Inclusion

<h2 id="toc_0">Overview</h2>

<p>Conversations and ideas surrounding inclusivity, equity, and diversity have been increasingly present regarding demographics defined by race and ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, disability status, parental status, and more. According to a recent study done by Glassdoor.com, &quot;About 1 in 3 employees and job seekers (32%) would not apply to a job at a company where there is a lack of diversity among its workforce.&quot;</p>

<p>In response to a summer of unrest surrounding racial injustice in 2020, and companies promising the public to &quot;do better,&quot;Â  Glassdoor has added a fairly new metric by which employees may rate companies they have worked for at present and in the past. The new &quot;Diversity &amp; Inclusion Rating&quot; is one small way that people can hold companies accountable to this promise. </p>

<p>This project seeks to identify diversity and inclusion ratings using natural language processing based on a company&#39;s mission statement. </p>
