Shelter Insurance® has weathered many catastrophic storms through the years including the Joplin Tornado in 2011; the Moore, Oklahoma tornado in 2013; Hurricanes Rita, Katrina and Laura, and more recently, the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. At the core of the Shelter brand is the willingness to do the right thing. We have held steady and strong in times of crisis, helping customers and communities rebuild and thrive for the future. It is a promise which continues today and into the future.

Imagine every transaction you make — every tank of gas, cup of coffee, or pair of sneakers, every movie ticket, meal kit, or streamed song, every sensor-to-sensor ping. Nearly every time you make a purchase, whether physical or digital, there’s an accompanying unique and nuanced compliance calculation.

Avalara works with businesses of all sizes, all over the world — from corner stores to gigantic global retailers — to calculate tax accurately and automatically, at speeds measured in milliseconds.

Company Culture

Simon-Kucher’s common values include integrity, respect, team spirit, and entrepreneurship. Employees on all levels especially live up to the latter: All of our partners are not only owners of the company, they are also entrepreneurs in the truest sense of the word. Every day, they are driving forward the firm’s economic success and future development.
Looking at our own corporate strategy, we practice what we preach and apply the same philosophy to our own business that we recommend to clients through our publications. We are not a general strategy shop, and do not take on projects such as cost-cutting or restructuring that require skills outside of our specialized scope. Simon-Kucher remains committed to growth in our own niche, building on our existing client relationships, attracting new clients, expanding into new industries, and opening offices in emerging and developed markets, all the while focusing on what we do best: pricing, sales and marketing strategies – an approach we refer to as TopLine Power®.

These triumphs paved the way for Hendrick to purchase Charlotte, North Carolina-based City Chevrolet. Under Hendrick's leadership, the dealership became the No. 1 volume Chevrolet franchise throughout North Carolina and South Carolina.

In late 1979, despite strong in-market competition, Hendrick built the first free-standing Honda dealership in Columbia, South Carolina. The location was a showcase for Honda, promoting it as the manufacturer's premiere dealership on the east coast and a future facility benchmark.

We employ more than 12,000 people in six countries and participate in every aspect of crop nutrition development.

We mine and process phosphate and potash minerals into crop nutrients, and then ship via rail, barge and ocean-going vessel to our customers in the major agricultural centers of the world.

The work of mining and processing potash and phosphate minerals is an energy- and water-intensive endeavor. We work carefully to maximize efficiencies and minimize our use of energy and natural resources, and have made significant progress in reducing Mosaic’s environmental footprint.

Mosaic is an important driver of economic activity in each of our operating communities. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor, using our financial resources, expertise and innovative spirit to demonstrate our shared commitment to good corporate citizenship.


Potash

Mosaic is a leader in the potash industry with annual capacity of 10.5 million tonnes of product per year. Production during 2016 totaled 7.6 million tonnes, or approximately 13% of estimated world annual production and 42% of estimated North American annual production.

In 2016, we operated three potash mines in Canada, including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine, as well as one potash shaft mine in the United States. We also own related refineries at each of the mines. Construction of our new Saskatchewan potash operation, Esterhazy K3, remains on target, with work expected to continue into 2024. Upon completion of K3, Mosaic's Esterhazy operation is expected to be the largest, most competitive underground potash mine in the world. Mosaic is committed to building strong relationships with the communities that surround our operations. First Nations and Métis people are an important part of the community in Saskatchewan, Canada, where we operate. Many Indigenous communities, particularly those in Treaty 4 territory, neighbor our potash facilities.


Phosphate

Mosaic is one of the world’s largest producers of finished phosphate products. We own and operate mines and production facilities in North and South America which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphate-based animal feed ingredients. Our North American phosphates operations have the capacity to produce 11.7 million tonnes of phosphate fertilizer. Our South American operations include five phosphates mines and five chemical and fertilizer facilities in Brazil with a capacity to produce 10.5 million tonnes of finished concentrated phosphate.

History

Mosaic is a young company rooted in history and experience. Recognized as innovators in our field, this status owes much to the combined strengths of the crop nutrition business of Cargill, Inc. and IMC Global Inc., our founding companies. Each of these companies has been recognized as worldwide leaders in the crop nutrition industry for decades. In 2014, Mosaic completed its acquisition of the phosphate business of CF Industries, Inc., and Archer Daniels Midland Company's fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay. In 2018, Mosaic completed its acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes from Vale S.A. and became one of the leading fertilizer producer and distributor in Brazil.

IMC Global dates back to 1909, when entrepreneur Thomas Meadows became involved in the phosphate mining business. In 1940, the company mined 50,000 tonnes of potash from its Carlsbad, N.M., plant. IMC Global mined approximately 1.7 million tonnes in the same location in 2003, helping the company earn $2.2 billion in revenue.

A grain backhaul opportunity launched the crop nutrition business of Cargill in the 1960s. Product was needed to fill empty barges to make a profitable roundtrip, so Cargill — already a leading agribusiness company — entered the crop nutrition business. From there, the division grew to be one of the world's top producers of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer.","Mission: Since forming in 2004, Mosaic has grown to be a global leader in phosphates and potash crop nutrition. We are proud to be a competitive low-cost producer with strong customer relationships, and the financial strength to invest in growth and innovation. And we’ve led the industry in developing high-quality performance products that help growers succeed. None of Mosaic’s success would be possible without our greatest asset—our people.
