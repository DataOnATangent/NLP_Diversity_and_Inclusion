Company Culture

Simon-Kucher’s common values include integrity, respect, team spirit, and entrepreneurship. Employees on all levels especially live up to the latter: All of our partners are not only owners of the company, they are also entrepreneurs in the truest sense of the word. Every day, they are driving forward the firm’s economic success and future development.
Looking at our own corporate strategy, we practice what we preach and apply the same philosophy to our own business that we recommend to clients through our publications. We are not a general strategy shop, and do not take on projects such as cost-cutting or restructuring that require skills outside of our specialized scope. Simon-Kucher remains committed to growth in our own niche, building on our existing client relationships, attracting new clients, expanding into new industries, and opening offices in emerging and developed markets, all the while focusing on what we do best: pricing, sales and marketing strategies – an approach we refer to as TopLine Power®.

After high school, he pursued a co-op work-study program with North Carolina State University and Westinghouse Electric Company in Raleigh, North Carolina.

While in Raleigh, Hendrick opened a small used-car lot with established dealer Mike Leith. Its success convinced Leith to name him general sales manager of his new-car import operation at the age of 23.

Founding:

In 1976, Hendrick sold off his assets to purchase a struggling franchise in Bennettsville, South Carolina, thus becoming, at 26, the youngest Chevrolet dealer in the United States. His influence sparked a dramatic sales increase as the once troubled location soon became the region's most profitable.

These triumphs paved the way for Hendrick to purchase Charlotte, North Carolina-based City Chevrolet. Under Hendrick's leadership, the dealership became the No. 1 volume Chevrolet franchise throughout North Carolina and South Carolina.

In late 1979, despite strong in-market competition, Hendrick built the first free-standing Honda dealership in Columbia, South Carolina. The location was a showcase for Honda, promoting it as the manufacturer's premiere dealership on the east coast and a future facility benchmark.

Bennettsville's success was also a precursor to Hendrick Automotive Group, a company that would be built on the winning foundation Hendrick established during this period of time.
