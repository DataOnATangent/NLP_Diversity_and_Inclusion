On December 27th, 1972, our Founder and Chairman, Nathan S. Collier bought his first piece of real estate in Gainesville, FL.

Today, The Collier Companies owns more than 50 communities and greater than 11,000 apartments in Gainesville, Ocala, Orlando, Tampa, Tallahassee, and Port Orange, as well as Oklahoma, and Georgia. This portfolio consists of approximately 50% student housing and 50% conventional apartments. The Collier Companies has consistently been ranked within the top 25 largest student housing owners as well as top student housing management companies in the country by Student Housing Business magazine. The Collier Companies is the largest student housing portfolio owned by a private individual. We’re currently staffed with approximately 500 team members and continuing to grow at an accelerated rate!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Collier Companies started in the early 1970’s by Founder & Chair, Nathan S. Collier. Nathan Collier leads the Real Estate Program at the University of Florida which has been nominated “Real Estate Program of the Year” on multiple occasions.

“It’s a unique experience to work for someone who stays on top of the latest industry trends and builds his business around those principles; the social contract, stewardship & principled profit.” – Garrett Gispanski, Talent Acquisition & Retention Leader

The Collier Companies Home Office is based in downtown Gainesville, FL and its communities stretch throughout FL, GA & OK. Currently, the real estate portfolio holds approximately 50 communities, boasting around 11,000 apartments homes; comprising approx. 50% student housing & 50% multi-family.

The Collier Companies has committed to doubling its size within the coming decade and there’s an array of strategies taking place to make that happen.

First, anyone can look at the national trend to see the influx of population moving to Florida. It’s currently the #1 destination in the country for where people are moving today. With this migration, the needle is pointing up, making it a great state to invest in real estate.

More than 51,000 people moved to Tampa and the surrounding area within the past year. Orlando is growing 360 degrees, adding an additional 60,000 residents since last year. Even little old Jacksonville, a second-tier city is currently #4 in the nation for where millennials are moving right now. Don’t get me started on the space race… Intrigued?

It’s no secret that multi-family is becoming mainstream. You can dig into the numbers on what percent of individuals move into a multifamily setting after moving to a new state (that ties us back to the growing demand in Florida due to the population boom). Or, we can look at generational trends – where over 70% of millennials are renting vs. living in a single-family home setting.

There’s a perfect storm brewing in Florida and The Collier Companies Home Office is centrally located in the middle of it. With all these projections, it’s easy to connect the dots. Nathan and Team will double its size by hyper focusing on the market growth and multifamily demand throughout the state of Florida.

The roots have already been planted; now The Collier Companies possesses the luxury to continue its growth in its own back yard. Not to mention, this Team is self-funded! The company doesn’t need to raise money from investors or syndicate deals to get the ball rolling; this provides incredible advantages when spear heading the marketplace.

What sets this team apart? In the multifamily arena, there’s contenders and then, there’s pretenders.

Companies that are operated out of other regions will trace the dots to success and throw up a hail marry to acquire an asset, maximize occupancy, then sell the property for a profitable margin – or at least, that’s the idea. Within that business model, there’s no long-term plan to maintain the quality of a brand or culture and eventually, the property will go through a rollercoaster ride of ownership and management.

The Collier Companies, however, is in constant search to purchase land, build new, maximize occupancy, then HOLD the property for a steady stream of cash flow. The longevity plan to hold and self-manage is what separates quality in this world; The Collier Companies is not operating to perform “quick flips”. This stabilizes the property in the long run, increasing Team Member morale, and ultimately, influencing the end user’s experience by enhancing the community for long term interest.

Why does this matter to you? There’s a strategy in place and it makes business sense. With this kind of growth plan, there is an ongoing effort to acquire the best talent. The Collier Companies is interested in bringing leaders in who can steer the ship within their role. As an individual who wants to grow in their career, how can one not like the idea of being the face of change, rather than the byproduct?

Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams,501 to 1000 Employees,"Columbus, OH",Casual Restaurants,4.3,3.8,4.2,3.9,3.6,3.5,3.6,See All 140 Reviews,"Mission:
We are absolutely devoted to making better ice creams and bringing people together. We believe that REALLY great ice cream served perfectly in a sparkling and beautiful space, with attentive and in-the-moment service brings people together and helps them connect. And that sometimes sparks fly. And that there should be more sparks flying, generally. We like to make people feel good.

Our Ice Creams:
Our ice creams have a uniquely smooth texture and buttercream body, with bright flavor and clean finish (we don’t use synthetic flavorings, dyes, or off-the-shelf mixes). You may notice the absence of a long list of stabilizers and emulsifiers on our label; we prefer the more complex process of building texture and flavor without them. Our flavors stand alone straight from the pint or melt perfectly into a fruit pie, birthday cake, crumble, crisp, or cookie—the perfect accessory for your dessert.

The Fellowship Model:
It takes a community of people to build ice cream from the ground up: growers, makers, producers, suppliers, customers. We call it the fellowship model—combining values from the good food world with tools from the 21st century. We believe we get higher quality ingredients when we have relationships with the people we’re buying from, so we buy direct whenever we can. Making ice cream this way requires more work and skill than traditional ice creams made with flavorings and colorings, but we think it’s worth it.

Our Company:
Jeni’s is a Certified B Corporation endorsed by the international nonprofit B Lab as a company that meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability, and transparency. Using Direct Trade and Fair Trade ingredients, employing a diverse team of people, working with women- and minority-owned businesses—it’s all part of how we operate and an important part of our company culture.

History:
Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams was founded in 2002 by James Beard Award-winning cookbook author Jeni Britton Bauer. Britton Bauer’s ahead-of-the-trend vision—using whole ingredients and dairy from grass-pastured cows, rather than synthetic flavorings and commodity ice cream mix—coupled with inspired flavors, sparked the artisan ice cream movement more than a decade before it would become a top food trend. Today, Jeni’s is a certified B Corporation and multi-channel retailer with 34 company-owned scoop shops, a robust e-commerce presence, and distribution in top groceries across the country.",N/A

In 1910 he traded his luxurious hotel for 240 prime acres of pear orchards in Southern Oregon’s Rogue River Valley and named his orchard after Bear Creek, which flowed through the fertile valley. In 1914, after also graduating from Cornell with agricultural degrees, Harry and David inherited the orchards and established the company we know today.

The brothers chose to specialize in Comice pears, the intensely sweet and juicy pears originally from the south of France and highly coveted in upscale European markets. Though they required very specific growing conditions and were hard to produce in abundance, the Rogue Valley proved ideal, and the special variety that the brothers cultivated was even more delicious, and hardier, than its French counterpart. To set their remarkable pears apart from all others, Harry and David branded their luxurious pears “Royal Riviera.”

By 1934, with Royal Rivera® Pears gaining worldwide popularity, Harry & David began creating gourmet gifts featuring their pears. Building on their initial success, they came up with gift baskets, Fruit-of-the-Month Club® Collections, and enticing gift towers, including the Signature Holiday Tower of Treatssup® Gift, still our most popular gift. The brothers paid scrupulous attention to every detail, and quality was their number one goal.

To this day, we still hand pick all of our fruit at peak ripeness, craft our own baked goods and confections, pack our gifts by hand, and ship everything to arrive in perfect condition, ready to share and enjoy.

Wolferman’s and Stock Yards
Two other venerable brands complete the Harry & David portfolio. Wolferman’s has been synonymous with fine baking since 1888, and is most known for their incredible English muffins. We’ve expanded their offerings to include breads, pastries, cakes, and other delicious treats along with breakfast and brunch items, pantry essentials, and even complete meals.

We often hear that working at Aya feels like working with family, and we encourage that sentiment with frequent social activities in and outside of work. A casual dress code means employees come to work feeling comfortable and ready to do their best work.

Employees’ hard work never goes unnoticed and there is a plethora of opportunities for career advancement within the organization. Because we’re growing so rapidly, it’s common to be promoted within the first year – or even the first few months!

Along with flexible hours and remote options, Aya encourages work-life balance and truly cares about the wellbeing of employees. The company takes feedback seriously when implementing changes or making decisions and continually looks for ways to improve to ensure employees enjoy coming to work every day.

Ultimately, what really matters is that everyone at Aya believes in what we’re doing as a company and how we’re effecting change within healthcare.

From the beginning, Windsor has been owned and operated by generations of the Zekaria family. Their caring vision of shared beauty affects everything we do.

Women come to Windsor to find that perfect look that makes them feel beautiful and we have been there for them for all of life’s important moments - your first kiss at the dance, graduation, the big interview and the wedding party. Lives have been changed, and the memories will live forever.

Windsor continues to bring that Oasis experience to you in over 200 stores and through our online shop.

Some things should never change.",N/A
