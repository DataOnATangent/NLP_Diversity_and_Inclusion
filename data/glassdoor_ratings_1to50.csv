At the core of our practice is a deep desire to help people live a better and more fulfilled life. The firm was founded over 30 years ago in Santa Barbara, California, and we currently serve clients throughout California and across the country.","Mission: Messy Truth.

The financial services industry is broken. Rather than respect, it too often patronizes. Rather than clarify, it complicates. Rather than empathetic, it’s self interested.
The root of the problem is that the financial services industry has grown to focus more on its own success than on the people it’s supposed to serve. It doesn’t ask the right questions. It avoids messy truths and doesn’t help anyone achieve what most everyone is hoping for: a happier and more fulfilled life with less worry and doubt.

Instead, many people feel confused, unintelligent and worried about their financial futures. This bothers us because it can be different. We’ve built our organization to be the antidote, a cure rooted in establishing a truer and enduring connection that removes artificial barriers and relationships.

People can expect a higher standard from us. We insist on more from ourselves and from the people we serve. That, to us, is what it means to truly care.

At West Coast Financial, to care is the beginning of service. To serve someone, we must know them. We share time and we are inquisitive and observant. That’s how the truth is discovered. Some people are uncomfortable with questions that get too close to the truth. That’s okay. We help each other through it. Because it’s important and we’re going to be together for a long time. It’s a relationship. We will chart our course together."

While we’re well-known for what we do (award-winning software solutions), the why and how are even more interesting.

We’re a technology company, but we’re really a people company. This comes out in three primary ways:

How We Hire

We believe you can’t manage passion, but you can hire for it. And passion is valuable beyond measure. Passion is what elevates work from checking boxes to disrupting industries.

That’s why we prioritize passion and culture fit when we’re meeting with potential candidates. And we don’t stop after they’re hired. We review roles and duties every quarter to make sure our team members get to spend as much time as possible focused on what they’re passionate about.

The payoff to this unusual approach: Our team member’s feedback routinely ranks us as a Best Places to Work and in the top 10% of companies in Officevibe’s global database.

How We Serve

One of our core values is Customer Focused and we live it every day. At Persolvent, we frame our relationships with customers as true partnerships. We offer industry-leading technology and have a large customer base, but we’re intentionally focused and small enough to be able to respond to customer needs with lightning-fast agility. If you come to us with a concern, we don’t route you to a third party. We find a solution.

We also don’t shy away from feedback (from team members or customers) and we’re constantly innovating to be better than the day before.

Thanks to our commitment to the pursuit of authentic, mutually beneficial partnerships, our customers feel comfortable bringing their customers to us, because they know we’ll do the right thing.

How We Give Back

When we succeed, deserving people all over the world benefit. We’re a deeply charitable company that gives 10% of our pretax profits to causes including Feed My Starving Children; Food for the Poor; Sharing & Caring Hands; Wishes & More; Achieve Services; and ChildFund® International. We also leverage our technology into a division called Payments for Change, which supports nonprofits and commits 50 cents on every dollar to charity.

Beyond financial support, our team members roll up their sleeves and put their time and talent to work. Each year, our team selects service projects to support, including packing and sending food and hygiene kits to those in need.

We have a special relationship with the community in a small town in Mutomo, Kenya, where we’ve sponsored several projects including the construction of a kitchen and playgrounds at local schools, providing hearing aids for 150 students at the school for the deaf.

So are we a technology company or a people company? We think we can be both. Speaking of people, we love meeting new ones.

When data, systems, and processes are seamlessly connected, they generate more value for the organization they are in. Similarly, when people are connected through teams, communities, and organizations, they produce better outcomes for everyone. Building communities and integrating technologies is how humans have survived and thrived.

Our future depends on us continuing to connect and integrate. Technology is generating new concepts and ideas at an ever-increasing rate. Many organizations are struggling to create or integrate the right mix of new tools and technologies to stay relevant. The speed at which companies are replaced on the S&P 500 is dramatically increasing. At the same time, individuals and communities are struggling with the impact of technology on their lives. A recent UCLA study found each successive generation of Americans is actually getting lonelier, despite decades of technological innovation aimed at solving that problem. A recent Harvard study concludes that the single most significant predictor of an individual’s mental and physical health is the depth and number of relationship connections they have.

Connecting with the people of our communities and connecting the systems that support them is what motivates us at Big Compass. We hope to help the world lean on each other a little more, leaving it a little better than the way we found it.",N/A
