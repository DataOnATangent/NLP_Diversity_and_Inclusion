The Mosaic Company,10000+ Employees,"Tampa, FL",Chemical Manufacturing,3.8,3.8,3.5,3.7,3.1,4.0,3.4,See All 267 Reviews,"The Mosaic Company (NYSE: MOS) is the world's leading integrated producer and marketer of concentrated phosphate and potash. We employ more than 12,000 people in six countries and participate in every aspect of crop nutrition development.

We mine and process phosphate and potash minerals into crop nutrients, and then ship via rail, barge and ocean-going vessel to our customers in the major agricultural centers of the world.

The work of mining and processing potash and phosphate minerals is an energy- and water-intensive endeavor. We work carefully to maximize efficiencies and minimize our use of energy and natural resources, and have made significant progress in reducing Mosaic’s environmental footprint.

Mosaic is an important driver of economic activity in each of our operating communities. We strive to be a thoughtful and engaged neighbor, using our financial resources, expertise and innovative spirit to demonstrate our shared commitment to good corporate citizenship.


Potash

Mosaic is a leader in the potash industry with annual capacity of 10.5 million tonnes of product per year. Production during 2016 totaled 7.6 million tonnes, or approximately 13% of estimated world annual production and 42% of estimated North American annual production.

In 2016, we operated three potash mines in Canada, including two shaft mines with a total of three production shafts and one solution mine, as well as one potash shaft mine in the United States. We also own related refineries at each of the mines. Construction of our new Saskatchewan potash operation, Esterhazy K3, remains on target, with work expected to continue into 2024. Upon completion of K3, Mosaic's Esterhazy operation is expected to be the largest, most competitive underground potash mine in the world. Mosaic is committed to building strong relationships with the communities that surround our operations. First Nations and Métis people are an important part of the community in Saskatchewan, Canada, where we operate. Many Indigenous communities, particularly those in Treaty 4 territory, neighbor our potash facilities.


Phosphate

Mosaic is one of the world’s largest producers of finished phosphate products. We own and operate mines and production facilities in North and South America which produce concentrated phosphate crop nutrients and phosphate-based animal feed ingredients. Our North American phosphates operations have the capacity to produce 11.7 million tonnes of phosphate fertilizer. Our South American operations include five phosphates mines and five chemical and fertilizer facilities in Brazil with a capacity to produce 10.5 million tonnes of finished concentrated phosphate.

History

Mosaic is a young company rooted in history and experience. Recognized as innovators in our field, this status owes much to the combined strengths of the crop nutrition business of Cargill, Inc. and IMC Global Inc., our founding companies. Each of these companies has been recognized as worldwide leaders in the crop nutrition industry for decades. In 2014, Mosaic completed its acquisition of the phosphate business of CF Industries, Inc., and Archer Daniels Midland Company's fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay. In 2018, Mosaic completed its acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes from Vale S.A. and became one of the leading fertilizer producer and distributor in Brazil.

IMC Global dates back to 1909, when entrepreneur Thomas Meadows became involved in the phosphate mining business. In 1940, the company mined 50,000 tonnes of potash from its Carlsbad, N.M., plant. IMC Global mined approximately 1.7 million tonnes in the same location in 2003, helping the company earn $2.2 billion in revenue.

A grain backhaul opportunity launched the crop nutrition business of Cargill in the 1960s. Product was needed to fill empty barges to make a profitable roundtrip, so Cargill — already a leading agribusiness company — entered the crop nutrition business. From there, the division grew to be one of the world's top producers of phosphate and nitrogen fertilizer.","Mission: Since forming in 2004, Mosaic has grown to be a global leader in phosphates and potash crop nutrition. We are proud to be a competitive low-cost producer with strong customer relationships, and the financial strength to invest in growth and innovation. And we’ve led the industry in developing high-quality performance products that help growers succeed. None of Mosaic’s success would be possible without our greatest asset—our people.

Each employee at Mosaic adheres to the same companywide principles and priorities, and contributes to our company strategy: to win in our core businesses of phosphates, potash and international distribution, and to grow in new ways."

THE SHORT STORY... Back in 1995, a college kid with absolutely no restaurant experience decided he wanted to open a restaurant - a Tex-Mex restaurant. Everyone thought he was a little crazy, but it turns out that's just what the restaurant landscape needed at the time - the weird, the wild, the insanely great food of Tijuana Flats.

Judging from our eclectic “non-chain” vibe, it may seem like we don’t have a care in the world. But the truth is, we care deeply about the people in our company, restaurants and communities. Which is why we attract the best-of-the-best team members who engage with guests from the time they walk in to the time they leave. We may be fast casual, but everyone at Tijuana Flats takes the time to truly care. That’s just how we roll.

Since day one, Tijuana Flats has always given back to the community. But in January 2007, we created the Just in Queso Foundation to give back even more. Much more. We’ve raised over $4,000,000 and counting, and our team members have donated countless hours to help those in need. We give back internally too through team member scholarships, a team member assistance fund and other in-house initiatives.

Fast forward to 2020 - Tijuana Flats now has 123 locations in five lucky states with a goal of adding more locations in 2021. So to all the college kids or parents of college kids out there, remember, success isn't something you can gain overnight. It’s something you can gain over many nights at college bars.","Mission: We satisfy people’s cravings for bold flavors and colorful experiences piled high with big-hearted over-the-top service. And we proudly celebrate every person and every community with Tex Mex For All. That nicely sums up what we do. But who are we at our core and what do we believe? Our core values can answer that. They’re the main things we believe are important in life and behaviors we strive to achieve at all times.

Our, CORE VALUES of Respect, Quality, Opportunity, Integrity, Fun & Community drive our unique culture, creating a solid foundation that increases value for our guests, partners & everyone in between."
