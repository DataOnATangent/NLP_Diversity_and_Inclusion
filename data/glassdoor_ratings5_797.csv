Our primary goal is to be a benefit to our customers, communities, employees and our nearly 1,400 licensed agents as we find ways to maintain our strong financial position and protect our policyholders. That view has served us well throughout our company’s history, and we expect it to carry us well into the future.

The Past to the Present
We opened our doors in 1946, but in those days, we were MFA Mutual Insurance® and we only offered auto insurance. We also only operated in Missouri.

The Group of Companies includes Shelter Life Insurance Company, Shelter Reinsurance®, AmShield Insurance® and Say Insurance®.

Shelter Mutual Insurance Company
Shelter Life Insurance Company – Formed in 1959 as MFA Life Insurance Company, Shelter Life is an A.M. Best “A” rated company that offers a wide variety of term and permanent life insurance policies.

Shelter Reinsurance Company - Incorporated in 1986, Shelter Reinsurance® is a wholly owned subsidiary of Shelter Mutual Insurance Company that is a financially sound, A.M. Best “A” rated company with a focus on spreading property exposures of the Shelter Insurance Group through conservative, diversified, long-term assumed reinsurance partnerships.

AmShield Insurance® Company – Created in 2014, AmShield is one of the youngest companies under the Shelter Mutual umbrella. AmShield offers competitively priced property and casualty insurance through independent agencies in three states: Arizona, Oregon and Indiana. AmShield has built its reputation around core values of integrity and financial stability, and is backed by exceptional customer service.

Shelter General Insurance Company
Say Insurance® - Say was created under the Shelter General Insurance brand as a way to reach customers who want to buy auto insurance online. It was launched in 2016 and is currently offered in six states: Illinois, Colorado, Missouri, Tennessee, Indiana and Kansas. It differentiates itself in the digital world with an easy-to-use online quoting process and customer account portal filled with helpful content.

Shelter from the Storm
Shelter Insurance® has weathered many catastrophic storms through the years including the Joplin Tornado in 2011; the Moore, Oklahoma tornado in 2013; Hurricanes Rita, Katrina and Laura, and more recently, the unprecedented COVID-19 crisis. At the core of the Shelter brand is the willingness to do the right thing. We have held steady and strong in times of crisis, helping customers and communities rebuild and thrive for the future. It is a promise which continues today and into the future.

Our Employees
None of our success could have been achieved without our dedicated employees. Our pride in our employees is mutual. Shelter has been named in the annual Best Places to Work in Insurance program four years in a row--2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Deciding where to grow your career can be daunting. You are probably considering many factors about many firms—geography, the type of law you’re interested in practicing, and each firm’s clients, people, commitment to those in need, and opportunities for professional development. Ropes & Gray’s dedication to performing cutting-edge work, nurturing a rich culture, practicing with purpose and investing in your success all demonstrate the kind of firm we are, and how we help you build an exciting and successful career.

When new colleagues join Ropes & Gray, they find a global team of approximately 1,400 lawyers whose top-notch skills, varied backgrounds and unique perspectives can help them meet high-stakes challenges, solve complex problems and reach their goals. An international presence, the firm has offices in New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Silicon Valley, London, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo and Seoul.

Many of the world’s most respected companies and institutions are longtime clients. We also serve many organizations (and investors and individuals) at all stages of the business life cycle, from the start-up phase to establishment as industry leaders. They come back to us year after year to handle their most important matters because, they say, we understand their businesses, are easy to work with and get results. Our collaborative approach means that our clients have ready access to leading corporate, litigation, transactional and regulatory lawyers whose knowledge and experience span industries and geographies.

Ropes & Gray offers programs that help attorneys and support team members provide excellent client service, grow in their careers and balance work/life demands.

Beyond providing exceptional legal training, we also offer flexible work arrangements that can help attorneys manage professional and personal responsibilities.

Another important aspect of professional life at Ropes & Gray is a commitment to public service—a hallmark of the firm, rooted in the example set by the firm’s founders 150 years ago. Pro bono work is truly a firmwide endeavor, supported by the energy and creativity that each of our 11 offices across the globe contributes to public service. Whether reuniting families separated at the U.S.–Mexico border, securing asylum for endangered immigrants, helping people keep their homes, winning the release of the wrongly convicted or arguing the landmark marriage equality case before the U.S. Supreme Court, Ropes & Gray provides the highest level of pro bono legal advice and support to individuals, organizations and causes.

Ropes & Gray lawyers and support team members also commit their time and energy to the communities in which we live and work. We mobilize to raise funds and participate in activities that benefit individuals, families, civic and nonprofit organizations, and cultural and educational institutions. Among other initiatives, we collect school supplies for children and food for the hungry, and have raised more than $2 million for cancer research through our participation in the annual Pan-Mass Challenge.

Along with our dedication to public service, Ropes & Gray places a top priority on diversity and inclusion. Year after year, we rank among the top U.S. firms for diversity. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion fosters a richer firm life, enhances our ability to attract and retain a highly talented workforce, gives us a deeper understanding of our growing roster of clients around the world, and continuously reinforces our own core values of excellence, fairness, collaboration and collegiality.

Together, all of these factors earned Ropes & Gray the number one ranking on The American Lawyer's 2018 ""A-List,"" the eighth consecutive year that the firm has been named to this key legal industry benchmark, which ranks the “best of the best.” The “A-List” recognizes the top 20 law firms in the United States by evaluating achievements in a number of key areas: firm performance, pro bono, diversity, associate satisfaction and the percentage of women in the equity partnership (a category in which the firm scored highest of all firms on the list).",N/A
