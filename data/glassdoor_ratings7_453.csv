If you’re passionate about building a better future for individuals, communities, and our country—and you’re committed to working hard to play your part in building that future—consider WGU as the next step in your career.

Driven by a mission to expand access to higher education through online, competency-based degree programs, WGU is also committed to being a great place to work for a diverse workforce of student-focused professionals. The university has pioneered a new way to learn in the 21st century, one that has received praise from academic, industry, government, and media leaders. Whatever your role, working for WGU gives you a part to play in helping students graduate, creating a better tomorrow for themselves and their families.

Diversity & Inclusion: Our foundation for student obsession.

We are inclusive. We embrace multiple approaches and points of view. We believe diversity drives innovation. This mindset is how we build our teams, develop leaders, and create an environment where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work.

We know our students are best served when our workforce is representative of their diverse needs. The many voices of our employees enrich the student experience and drive WGU’s mission to improve the lives of individuals and families. The idea for WGU was born in 1995 at a bipartisan meeting of the Western Governors Association (hence our ""western"" name). Going into the meeting, the chair of the association—Utah governor Mike Leavitt—had the foresight to realize that distance learning technologies had the power to tackle one of the western states’ most pressing problems: rapid population growth confronted by limited public funds for educational services.

The governors decided then and there to create their own university. They agreed that this new university would make maximum use of distance learning technologies, would be collaborative among the western member states, and would use competencies rather than seat time as the measure of its outcomes.","Mission: To do this, the governors enlisted the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education (WICHE) and the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems (NCHEMS) to help design the newly envisioned university. Five themes remained central to the effort:

Responsiveness to employment and societal needs.
A focus on competency-based education.
Expanding access.
Cost-effectiveness.
Development of a technology infrastructure."

Company Culture

Simon-Kucher’s common values include integrity, respect, team spirit, and entrepreneurship. Employees on all levels especially live up to the latter: All of our partners are not only owners of the company, they are also entrepreneurs in the truest sense of the word. Every day, they are driving forward the firm’s economic success and future development.
Looking at our own corporate strategy, we practice what we preach and apply the same philosophy to our own business that we recommend to clients through our publications. We are not a general strategy shop, and do not take on projects such as cost-cutting or restructuring that require skills outside of our specialized scope. Simon-Kucher remains committed to growth in our own niche, building on our existing client relationships, attracting new clients, expanding into new industries, and opening offices in emerging and developed markets, all the while focusing on what we do best: pricing, sales and marketing strategies – an approach we refer to as TopLine Power®.

After high school, he pursued a co-op work-study program with North Carolina State University and Westinghouse Electric Company in Raleigh, North Carolina.

While in Raleigh, Hendrick opened a small used-car lot with established dealer Mike Leith. Its success convinced Leith to name him general sales manager of his new-car import operation at the age of 23.

Founding:

In 1976, Hendrick sold off his assets to purchase a struggling franchise in Bennettsville, South Carolina, thus becoming, at 26, the youngest Chevrolet dealer in the United States. His influence sparked a dramatic sales increase as the once troubled location soon became the region's most profitable.

These triumphs paved the way for Hendrick to purchase Charlotte, North Carolina-based City Chevrolet. Under Hendrick's leadership, the dealership became the No. 1 volume Chevrolet franchise throughout North Carolina and South Carolina.

In late 1979, despite strong in-market competition, Hendrick built the first free-standing Honda dealership in Columbia, South Carolina. The location was a showcase for Honda, promoting it as the manufacturer's premiere dealership on the east coast and a future facility benchmark.

Bennettsville's success was also a precursor to Hendrick Automotive Group, a company that would be built on the winning foundation Hendrick established during this period of time. A culture built on a strong set of core values: teamwork through trust and respect; integrity; commitment to customer enthusiasm; passion for winning; accountability at all levels. servant leadership, and commitment to continuous improvement.
